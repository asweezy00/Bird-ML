    "This notebook is meant to give you an introduction to some of the features of Jupyter Notebooks, and give you a chance to run a machine learning task of your own.  I will have already run this program in class -- your job is to get it to work for you.  In the future, you may work with other students in the class in a group.  Today, however, you must run this program on your own, so you know how to carry out all the steps.  You should save a copy of this program to your own google drive.  Your first assignment is to delete this paragraph and write your own name into this cell."
